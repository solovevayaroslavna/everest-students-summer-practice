    # Authentication
    All requests to Everest API require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header with a valid token in plain-text.
    
    The token can be obtained by using `everestctl token reset` which resets the token and prints it to the screen.

        This API returns a list of permissions for the user that is currently logged in.
        
        *Example:*
        Assume the following RBAC policy, and users `alice` and `bob`:
        ```
        p, role:dev, namespaces, read, *
        p, role:dev, database-engines, *, */*
        p, role:dev, database-clusters, *, */*
        p, bob, database-clusters, *, */*
        g, alice, role:dev
        ```
        The API will return the following permissions for `alice`:
        ```
        {
          "permissions": [
            [
                "alice",

        And the following permissions for `bob`:
        ```
        {
          "permissions": [

            is opaque and may be used to issue another request to the endpoint that served
            this list to retrieve the next set of available objects. Continuing a consistent
            list may not be possible if the server configuration has changed or more than
            a few minutes have passed. The resourceVersion field returned when using this

            the field will be left unset and omitted during serialization. If the list
            is complete (either because it is not chunking or because this is the last
            chunk), then there are no more remaining items and this field will be left
            unset and omitted during serialization. Servers older than v1.15 do not set
            this field. The intended use of the remainingItemCount is *estimating* the
            size of a collection. Clients should not rely on the remainingItemCount to
            be set or to be exact.
